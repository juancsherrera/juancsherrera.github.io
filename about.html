	<p>I'm a Data Scientist. I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/degree/phd-food-studies/student-biographies">Food Studies at New York University</a>. I am passionate about using data science to study a diverse set of social problems that guide decisions. 
		During my professional and academic career I have used econometrics, network science, and machine learning with tools such as Python, R, SQL, and SAS to analyze different topics. Please see my projects for further information.
